# Linear Regression with Random Numbers:

This repository contains a Python implementation of linear regression using random numbers. The code generates random input data, performs linear regression, and plots the true values along with the predicted values on a linear line.

# Logistic Regression with Iris Dataset
This repository contains Python code to demonstrate logistic regression using the famous Iris dataset. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing datasets where the outcome variable is binary, in this case, whether a flower is Iris-Virginica (1) or not (0) based on its petal width.
This generates a plot showing the logistic regression model's probabilities for being Iris-Virginica and not being Iris-Virginica based on petal width. Additionally, the script predicts the class labels for specific petal widths.
